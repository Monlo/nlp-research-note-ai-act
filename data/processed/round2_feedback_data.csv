Joanna Karczewska (Poland),"The Proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act includes the following statement: ""A comprehensive ex-ante conformity assessment through internal checks, combined with a strong ex-post enforcement, could be an effective and reasonable solution for those systems, given the early phase of the regulatory intervention and the fact the AI sector is very innovative and expertise for auditing is only now being accumulated."" I would like to point out...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2522258_en,29

Anonymous (Italy),"Although among the purposes of the regulation it is mentioned ensuring people's right to get access to certain essential private services (e.g. financial services), the regulation includes among banking sector high-risk AI systems only those for creditworthiness assessment and omit those for customer due diligence required by EU AML/CFT Directive. No need to say that AML/CFT risk scoring comes one step earlier than credit risk scoring (before...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2334478_en,29
The Value Engineers (Netherlands),The proposed regulation is an excellent initiative but needs improvement to be applicable to the cases for which it is intended. The definition of AI The definition of AI in Article 3.1 is contingent on the current state of the art. The Commission has the right to update the list of techniques given in Annex I (Article 4) but on the basis of what criteria would it do so? Radically new techniques such as artificial organic brains would be...,https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2324448_en,29

Agence du Numérique (AdN) (Belgium),"Please find below our feedback on the AI impact assessment. - More classical algorithms such as linear regression have been around for many, many years and have almost never caused any damage or frustration. Artificial intelligence is a modern term that scares people, but in reality it is only an applied technology (mathematical, statistical,...) on data. And it is therefore the data and its use that is at the heart of the problem. The most...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2256808_en,30
gauthier lasou (France),"Un règlement européen qui va définir des exigences éthiques et juridiques pour les usages de l'IA en Europe. écrit en anglais, 108 pages + les annexes, études d'impact etc. A ma connaissance, vous vous adressez aux citoyens européens qui ne comprennent pas tous l'anglais, en particulier quand un jargon spécifique est employé pour définir des règles communes. Pour ma part, bien que lisant l'anglais, je suis contre ce règlement, uniquement...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2256463_en,30
SB Science Management UG (haftungsbeschränkt) (Germany),"Unfortunately, standardisation measures are still not very common in the life sciences R&D. In the same time, more and more AI solutions are finding their way into life science research and development. Therefore, standardisation between AI and the life sciences should be harmonised too. A note should be included on the necessity of harmonisation with standardisation measures in the field of natural sciences when AI solutions enters...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F2242340_en,30
Даниел Кузманов (Bulgaria),"Съвсем правилно е набелязан/избран вариант 3+ . Той има предпоставки да направи процеса на регулация най-лесен и бърз, при желание (🤓) на заинтересованите. А и в днешната реалност в ЕС изглежда най-лесно приложим.
