# Identifying AIâ€™s Environmental Risks: Using NLP to Analyzing Public Consultation Feedback on the AI Act 

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing public consultation feedback on the **AI Act**, focusing on environmental and climate-related concerns identified by stakeholders. The analysis involves **data scraping, cleaning, preprocessing, and textual analysis** to extract insights from feedback submitted by various stakeholders.

The workflow follows key **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques,  data scraping, sentence extraction, keyword filtering, and textual analysis to identify and analyze recurring themes and patterns in the feedback data.

## **Repository Structure**

### **data/**  
- Contains raw and processed datasets.

### **notebooks/** 

#### **01_scrapping.ipynb**  
- Scrapes public consultation feedback data from the **[European Commission's website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements_e)**.  

#### **02_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
- Cleans and standardizes the scraped text data.  

#### **03_preprocessing.ipynb**  
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis, extracts environmental risk mentions, generates word clouds, trains a Word2Vec model, and visualizes word embeddings 

#### **04_analysis.ipynb**  
- Applies sentence embeddings, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and KMeans clustering to group environmental risk feedback into semantic clusters.
- Summarizes cluster content using a pre-trained summarization model (BART) to highlight key insights

### **output/**  
- Stores outputs generated from the analysis notebooks,
