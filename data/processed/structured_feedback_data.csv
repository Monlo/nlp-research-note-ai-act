Access Now Europe (Belgium),"Access Now opposes the uptake of AI as an objective for a potential regulatory intervention.

David D'Haese (Belgium),"Dear, I am a teacher in AI at the AP University College in Antwerp particularly concerned with ethical issues. My idea is that Europe should postpone any legislation concerning ethics in AI, as enforcement of such a future law is expected to be not practical and possibly even counterproductive. Instead, I would imagine that devising and evangelising a clear set of moral rules comparable to Asimov's three 'laws' of robotics would have a real...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F549988_en,11
European Trade Union Confederation (Belgium),"IIA provides additional but still general information on options the EC intends to consider for legal act on AI. IIA still lacks to address the specificity of the workplace.

Software AG (Germany),"Software AG highly welcomes the Commission's objective to increase trust in AI thus fostering not only its use but also its development in Europe. We share the Commission's view that while AI can do much good, some of its uses and applications may cause both material and immaterial harm. Like the Commission we believe that trust is a precondition for the success of AI and that this objective can be best reached at Union level.

ANEC (Belgium),"As the European Commission’s assessment of product safety and liability legislation shows, there are gaps in present legislation and new AI related aspects such as explicability require new legal provisions, especially for enforcement purposes.

Anonymous,"• Certain rules or meaningful principles are needed to complement the existing legislative & regulatory framework (particularly those targeted at the avoidance of bias imposing a minimum of transparency & fairness obligations which will likely result in increased “explainability” efforts).

Dessislava Fessenko (Bulgaria),"Please review the attached PDF file. Feedback is provided therein. In a nutshell: I wish to hereby submit the views that: 1. Mandatory regulation is needed.

Voluntary labeling process outlined in the option #2 might have been effective, but not in the current stage where we already have extensive use of AI applications for malicious purposes (especially outside EU).

Bart De Witte (Germany),"As we had great concerns that the first release of the guidelines of trustworthy AI was released without going deeper into the first component, which is lawful AI.

Global Digital Foundation (Ireland),"Policy analysts and policymakers are responding to AI as both a threat to human rights and as a potential savour of humanity from discrimination. This response rests on two questionable ideas. The first is that AI’s supposed human-like intelligence could give it a mind or a ‘will’. The second is that decisions affecting socio-economic outcomes are, in reality, the instrumentalisation of unfair hierarchies—and that AI could make this problem...",https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12527-Artificial-intelligence-ethical-and-legal-requirements/F539194_en,13
